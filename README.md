# AzureTestPlanAPI
This repository contains a Python implementation of Test Plan API operations.
This shows the examples with 1 Test Plan, 1 Test Suite and 1 test case to illustrate how the process works.
However based on the needs, this can be modified to handle multiple Plans, Suites and Test Cases.
